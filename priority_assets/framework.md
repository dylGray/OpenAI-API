# Priority Pitch Framework

This document outlines the foundational structure and expectations for crafting a Priority Pitch — a short, persuasive narrative designed to capture a prospect’s attention and establish urgency for change.

## Overview

A Priority Pitch is a concise pitch (100–150 words, maximum 170) that presents:
- The **prospect** as the protagonist
- A **threat** as the antagonist
- The **seller’s solution** as the hero

The goal is to make the pitch emotionally resonant, strategically urgent, and easily speakable.

## Core Principles

- **Narrative Perspective**: Written in second person (“you”)
- **Reading Level**: 3rd to 6th grade (ideal: 4th–5th)
- **Delivery Style**: Should sound natural when spoken aloud
- **Tone**: Conversational, clear, and emotionally engaging

## Required Pitch Components

1. **Pain**  
   - Describe the prospect’s daily frustrations in their role.
   - Must be emotional, tangible, and specific — not generic.
   - Sets up why change is needed.

2. **Threat**  
   - Reveal the deeper business consequence tied to the pain.
   - Should feel urgent and strategic (e.g., lost revenue, turnover, risk exposure).
   - Answers the question: “So what?”

3. **Belief Statement**  
   - A short statement that builds trust and shows alignment with the prospect’s worldview.
   - Must start with “We believe you…” or “We believe success depends on…”
   - Must focus entirely on the **prospect**, not the seller.

4. **Relief**  
   - Explain how your solution addresses the **threat** at a strategic level.
   - Avoid listing features; focus on outcome and value.
   - Tie directly back to the risk outlined in the threat.

5. **Tone**  
   - Use language that’s simple, human, and emotionally engaging.
   - Avoid jargon, complexity, or robotic phrasing.
   - Aim for clarity and authenticity.

6. **Length**  
   - Ideal word count is between 100 and 150 words (hard max: 170).
   - Short enough to hold attention, long enough to convey a complete message.
   - Cut anything that doesn’t support the core message.

7. **Clarity**  
   - The pitch must be easy to speak aloud.
   - Avoid awkward phrases, run-ons, or overly complex ideas.
   - Aim for rhythm and conversational flow.
