# Priority Pitch Grading Criteria

Use the following checklist to evaluate any Priority Pitch submission. Grade as A/B/C/D/F based on total alignment and clarity.

## Required Elements
1. **Pain**: Does the pitch start by describing a relatable, emotional pain the prospect is feeling?
2. **Threat**: Is the deeper threat behind the pain clearly articulated?
3. **Belief Statement**:
   - Does it begin with “We believe…” or a similar structure?
   - Is it about the **prospect**, not the seller?
   - Is it something the prospect is likely to agree with?
4. **Relief**: Does the solution address the threat in a high-level way without being too feature-heavy?
5. **Tone**: Is the language emotional and accessible (3rd–6th grade reading level)?
6. **Length**: Is the pitch between 100 and 150 words (max 170)?
7. **Clarity**: Can it be easily spoken aloud?

## Optional Elements (Bonus)
- Compelling proof or stat that reinforces the solution.
- Soft CTA or transition to next step.

## Common Issues to Flag
❌ Belief is about the **seller** instead of the **prospect**.  
❌ Pitch lists features instead of explaining **how** the solution helps.  
❌ Jargon, dense language, or overly technical writing.  
❌ No threat (just pain), or threat isn’t urgent or company-wide.  
❌ Cost savings presented as the only value.

## Grading Scale
- **A** – All 4 parts present, clearly written, emotional, and tight (100–150 words, 4th–5th grade level).
- **B** – One part weak or missing; slightly too long or high reading level.
- **C** – Two or more parts weak or missing; message is unclear.
- **D** – Pitch is mostly about the product, lacks structure or emotional tone.
- **F** – Pitch is off-structure, unclear, and unrecognizable as a Priority Pitch.
