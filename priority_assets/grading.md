# Priority Pitch Evaluation Criteria

This document defines the 7 essential components that must be present in a strong Priority Pitch. Use these criteria to evaluate each pitch for completeness, structure, clarity, and alignment with the Priority Pitch Framework.

## 1. Pain
- Clearly describes a real, emotional, and specific frustration the prospect is experiencing in their role.
- Must feel relatable and urgent.
- Avoids vague or overly general statements.

**Example of strong pain**:  
> "Your reps are exhausted from chasing dead-end leads."

## 2. Threat
- Identifies the **strategic risk** or consequence that results from the pain.
- Answers the unspoken question: “So what?”
- Should feel like a business-level concern (e.g. missed targets, lost talent, market erosion).

**Example of strong threat**:  
> "That burnout is costing you deals — and you're losing top performers as a result."

## 3. Belief Statement
- Begins with “We believe you...” or “We believe success depends on...”
- Focuses entirely on the **prospect**, not the seller.
- Reflects an insight the prospect is likely to agree with.
- Helps establish trust or alignment early.

**Example of strong belief**:  
> "We believe you deserve better access to the right deals — not just more activity."

## 4. Relief
- Describes how the seller’s solution addresses the **threat** — not just the surface pain.
- Does **not** list product features.
- Stays high-level and outcome-focused.

**Example of strong relief**:  
> "We help teams engage decision-makers earlier, so reps win more — without burning out."

## 5. Tone
- Uses language that is clear, emotional, and conversational.
- Written at a 3rd–6th grade reading level (ideal: 4th–5th).
- Avoids jargon, technical terms, or abstract phrasing.

**Strong tone characteristics**:
- Short sentences
- Active voice
- Empathetic framing

## 6. Length
- Ideal pitch length is **100–150 words** (max 170).
- Long enough to develop narrative, short enough to hold attention.
- Avoids tangents, repetition, or over-explaining.

## 7. Clarity
- The pitch must **sound good aloud** — as if spoken naturally.
- Avoids awkward phrasing, unclear transitions, or excessive complexity.
- Easy for a sales rep to say confidently.

## Evaluation Notes

- All 7 elements are **required**. Missing or weak components should be flagged.
- Grade strictly — prioritize clarity, structure, and alignment over effort.
- Do not offer revision guidance or encouragement; your role is to evaluate only.
