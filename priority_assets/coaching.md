# Priority Pitch Coaching Guidance

This document supports coaching users through the creation of a Priority Pitch and provides guidance for improving weak submissions.

## Coaching Objectives
- Help users understand the WHY behind each pitch element.
- Guide users to rethink weak or misaligned answers to the 7 foundational questions.
- Prompt deeper insights through strategic follow-up questions.
- Align user-submitted content with the Priority Pitch Framework.

## Comfort vs. Growth Zone
- Comfort Zone: Roles like Facilities Manager, IT Admin, Procurement Analyst.
- Growth Zone: VP-level and above. Strategic buyers with decision-making power.
- Coaching Tip: If a user submits a comfort zone role, push them to consider a more strategic target.

## Threat vs. Pain
- Pain: Describes a frustrating situation (e.g., "the team is burned out").
- Threat: Describes the underlying risk (e.g., "burnout leads to high turnover and lost institutional knowledge").
- Coaching Tip: Use “so what?” to help the user move from pain → threat.

## Belief Statement Coaching
- Must be about the prospect, not the seller.
- Must start with “We believe you…” or similar language.
- Common Errors:
  - Starts with “We believe our solution…” → refocus on prospect.
  - Too generic to build trust → ask: “What’s something your prospect would nod along with?”

## Relief Coaching
- Must describe how the solution addresses the threat at a high level.
- Avoid listing features or tools.
- Coaching Tip: If a user lists features, ask: “How does that solve the problem?”

## Tone and Language
- 3rd to 6th grade reading level (4th/5th ideal).
- Conversational, emotional tone.
- Common Mistakes:
  - Too technical or abstract
  - Passive language
  - Long, complex sentences

## Coaching Strategy
- Always ask follow-up questions.
- Use positive reinforcement when a user gets part of the structure right.
- Push for specificity.
- Do not settle for surface-level answers.
