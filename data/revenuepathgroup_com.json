    "pitch": "Decommissioning of capital requires careful analysis. However, we have observed that this process often lacks consideration of a pathway that can significantly incorporate economic efficiencies while simultaneously improving operational efficiency. In fact, when we speak to maintenance managers, they often refer to planned obsolescence being incorporated into their routine planning.  We believe our maintenance program should be considered a viable alternative to decommissioning.  Our maintenance plan includes monthly checkups, along with reliable break-fix services. Unlike a maintenance contract, we don\u2019t charge an often-times expensive monthly fee. You will only be invoiced for the work that\u2019s completed. Our difference is that we\u2019ve been in business for 125 years. Our footprint is very large, and we staff the best engineers in the industry. What\u2019s more, we carry the stock parts and the tools needed for more models of equipment than any other maintenance provider in this industry.",

    "feedback": {
      "Pain": "The pitch does not clearly describe the prospect's daily frustrations. It only mentions that planned obsolescence is part of routine planning, but this does not necessarily indicate a pain point.",
      "Threat": "The pitch does not articulate a deeper threat behind the pain. It only mentions economic and operational efficiency, but these are not presented as urgent or company-wide threats.",
      "Belief Statement": "The belief statement is about the seller's solution, not the prospect. It should start with \"We believe you...\" or \"We believe success depends on...\", and it should focus solely on the prospect.",
      "Relief": "The solution is presented in a feature-heavy way, listing monthly checkups and break-fix services. It does not explain how these features address the threat at a high level.",
      "Tone": "The language is accessible and could resonate emotionally with the prospect.",
      "Length": "The pitch is within the 150-word limit.",
      "Clarity": "The pitch is not easily spoken aloud. It uses technical language and complex sentences. Your pitch needs significant revision to meet the Priority Pitch Framework. Start by identifying a clear pain that the prospect is experiencing. From there, articulate a deeper threat that stems from this pain. Your belief statement should focus on the prospect, not your solution. Finally, explain how your solution addresses the threat without listing features. Remember to keep the language simple and emotional.",

    "pitch": "You may not see it, but there is hidden waste in your equipment. It\u2019s expensive to buy. It\u2019s expensive to maintain. It\u2019s expensive to replace. It\u2019s robbing revenue and squeezing your margins. It\u2019s stunting growth.  We believe that your maintenance should be as lean as the rest of your operation. You just need the visibility to see where to cut it.  Our maintenance plans are different. You will get the transparency you need to cut the waste out of your maintenance agreement. With extended machine life, cost savings and even process improvements, you can start to take back the margins you deserve.",
    "score": "B**",
    "feedback": {
      "Pain": "The pitch clearly describes the prospect's pain, focusing on the hidden waste in equipment and the associated costs.",
      "Threat": "The threat is articulated well, highlighting the risk of revenue loss and squeezed margins due to the hidden waste.",
      "Belief Statement": "The belief statement starts correctly and focuses on the prospect. However, it could be more specific to build stronger trust.",
      "Relief": "The relief section starts well by stating how the solution differs from others. However, it becomes feature-heavy towards the end, mentioning extended machine life, cost savings, and process improvements. It would be better to focus on how these features address the threat.",
      "Tone": "The language is emotional and accessible, appealing to the prospect's frustrations and needs.",
      "Length": "The pitch is within the ideal word count.",
      "Clarity": "The pitch is clear and can easily be spoken aloud. Overall, the pitch is well-structured and meets most of the required elements. However, the relief section could be improved by focusing more on how the solution addresses the threat rather than listing the features. The belief statement could also be more specific to build stronger trust with the prospect.",
