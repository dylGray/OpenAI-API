    Build the system prompt for the AI model by loading context and instructions from markdown files.

    High-level overview:
    - Reads the Priority Pitch framework, grading criteria, coaching guidance, and prompt examples from local files.
    - Concatenates the contents into a single string (context) to provide the model with all necessary background and rules.
    - Appends strict instructions on how to evaluate, grade, and give feedback on user-submitted pitches.
    - Returns the full prompt string, which is sent as the "system" message to the OpenAI API.
